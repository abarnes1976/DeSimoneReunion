<B>When:</B>
Saturday, August 10th   11 AM - 4 PM

<B>Where:</B>
Massa Harbison Park (“the Girl Scout Little House”) in New Kensington, just across from Valley High School on Route 56


The event will take place rain or shine. We have the Little House all day, and you can arrive any time after 9 a.m. and stay until dusk, but we are planning for the core hours to be 11:00 a.m. until about 4:00 p.m..

The Little House has been updated in recent years. It is air-conditioned, has a small kitchen with working appliances, and has tables and chairs for up to 50 people. Outside the Little House is an expansive area of grass perfect for hanging out, picnic blankets, and games. There is also a small amphitheater for karaoke, stories, and maybe a sing-along!

There will be games for the kids, story-telling (bring your favorite Reunion-related stories!), maybe a lip-synch contest, karaoke, picture taking, family-tree activities, and as a special treat, George DeSimone will give a brief history of the DeSimone family, and other events. (Let us know if you have any other activity suggestions!)

To keep things organized, we’re asking each family to bring a main-dish for your immediate family, other food that your family may want, and at least one other dish to share (we’ll have a shared “buffet” table). In addition, please bring paper plates, cups, plastic ware, etc  for your own group. There will be coffee, bottled water, and kids’ drinks, but plan to bring any other drinks you’d like (other than alcohol – sorry, not even wine – the insurance policy precludes that!). As mentioned, there is a small kitchen where you can heat up hot food, but space for that is a little limited.

<B>What else to bring?</B>

Lawn chairs and picnic blankets – hoping for good weather and to be outside!
Umbrellas and rain gear (just in case. . . )
Folding table or card table if you have one, along with a table covering
Bug spray/sunscreen
Trash bag or two for your trash
Pictures, pictures, pictures of family, past reunions, etc. 
Anything else to help make the day fun
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
<B>What do we need?</B>

Electric keyboard/musical instruments
