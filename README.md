This is a very basic DeSimone Family Reunion page.  

If you have any requested changes to the family tree or images you would like to be included here, please email <A HREF="mailto:anthonybarnes@gmail.com"> anthonybarnes@gmail.com </A>.

The Family Tree has been updated based on all of the feedback from individuals who attended the 2024 reunion on Saturday August 10th at Massa Harbison Park as well as updates for the Maurizio DeSimone branch of the family from Audrey Celmo. Please take a minute to see what might have been missed or misentered. We would like to get this right and have as a resource as we look to get back together again next year, beyond, and maybe even many smaller opportunities in the meantime.
