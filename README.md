(Girl Scout Little House) <BR><BR>
<B> Core Hours </B> - Noon - 5:30 PM <BR>
<B> Group Picture </B> - 2:30 PM <BR>

We have the Little House all day, and you can arrive any time after 10 a.m. and stay until dusk, but we are planning for the core hours to be Noon until about 5:30 PM. <BR>

The Little House is air-conditioned, has a small kitchen with working appliances, and has tables and chairs for up to 50 people. Outside the Little House is an expansive area of grass perfect for hanging out, picnic blankets, and games. There is also a small amphitheater for karaoke, stories, and maybe a sing-along! <BR>

To keep things organized, we’re again asking each family to bring a main-dish for your immediate family and at least one other dish to share with others (we’ll have a shared “buffet” table in the kitchen area again). In addition, please bring paper plates, cups, plastic ware, etc. for your own group – we’ll have extras, though, so don’t worry too much. There will be coffee, bottled water, and kids’ drinks, but plan to bring any other drinks you’d like (other than alcohol – sorry, not even wine or spiked lemonade – the insurance policy precludes that!). As mentioned, there is a small kitchen where you can heat up hot food, but space is limited.
