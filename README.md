(Girl Scout Little House) <BR>

We have the Little House all day, and you can arrive any time after 9 a.m. and stay until dusk, but we are planning for the core hours to be 11:00 a.m. until about 4:00 p.m. <BR>

The Little House is air-conditioned, has a small kitchen with working appliances, and has tables and chairs for up to 50 people. Outside the Little House is an expansive area of grass perfect for hanging out, picnic blankets, and games. There is also a small amphitheater for karaoke, stories, and maybe a sing-along!
